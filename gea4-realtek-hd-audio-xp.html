                            <p>Hello everybody, So recently i encountered a strange problem. SupportAssist updated my Audio Driver and suddenly the driver was missing, and the PC was unable to find the speakers. No big deal, I will just download the driver manually and install it. However, I realised that the audio was a bit strange after that, went to Device Manager and tried updating the drivers, there was no update. And the Audio driver is just called Realtek Audio. "High Definition Audio" is missing from the name. Hi everyone. I'll make it short. Sometimes these two drivers conflict (assistance told me so) and the result is a crackling audio. if I restart the audio using this command: \ net stop audiosrv net start audiosrv\ , everything works again. So the problem is that windows installs the Intel HD driver by itself, even if I do a clean installation and disable the automatic updates. Any help? I thought about installing windows without drivers inside Okay, first of this is my PC (Yes it old): Windows Embedded POSReady 2009 (Which is just really Windows XP SP3) HP Pavilion a1102n, everything stock Intel Pentium 4 516 Intel GMA 900 (Graphics/Video Chip) 512MB of DDR2 Ram No internet (since it uses only ethernet and I can't connect it) Realtek HD Audio ASUSTek Goldfish3 motherboard. Now anyways, heres the issue: Im trying to play GTA SA. It states that "Could not find Audio Card installed". So naturally I check the readme This is how I boosted my XPS 15 gaming performance and was able to eliminate framedrops while also improving battery life SIGNIFICANTLY. Now I can run far cry new dawn at ultra at 40 fps average instead of 30. The culprit is the background services and drivers installed by dell. what is improved?: Audio Quality Battery Life Idle memory usage Overall thermals and performance Reduced lag DPC latency is also fixed step:1 clean install windows using a windows iso and rufus. Don't. Hey, Really frustrated right now, I'm having audio issues like sound popping and crackling so I've been trying to install Realtek HD driver using both Dells driver and using the driver in this link: https://www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/asdr64/dell\_xps\_9570\_new\_realtek\_high\_definition\_audio/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/asdr64/dell_xps_9570_new_realtek_high_definition_audio/) Since I don't have the HD version installed for some reason The installation succeed everytime. HAPPY NEW YEAR!! Okay, so a little context. I just got my XPS15 last Friday. Since then I've been experiencing occasional speaker crackling along with just very low-budget sounding audio in general. In an attempt to remedy the situation, I visited several forums all suggesting to download and install Realtek's audio driver from their site and NOT from Dell's. However, reinstalling audio drivers with Realtek's files didn't fix anything. There were pages and pages of people saying the "fix". Note: I've included every system detail I can think of including at the bottom of the question. I've been dealing with symptoms of systems sluggishness for a couple weeks on my laptop when docked using external screens. Moving windows is choppy, videos on either screen drop frames and stall, input (mouse and keyboard) choppiness during while multitasking with video running (eg Twitch stream running while doing data entry), very bad screen tearing (this specifically might be a red herring 
Hi all, I am having trouble with audio for my new build. Everything seems to be running smoothly except I am unable to get audio from the 3.5 mm jacks in the front and back (green port). I confirmed that audio does come through a USB headset I have, but I am not sure why I can't hear anything when I plug in my 3.5 mm jack headphones. When I'm playing a video, for example, I can even see the green bars moving, but the audio is not coming through the headphones. I have confirmed I have a Dell XPS 8000 series machine running up-to-date Windows 10 home. Whenever I try to plug a headset into the microphone jack, it won't recognize any input from the microphone itself. Instead, it will try to take microphone input from the headset speakers. Basically, I can tap or yell into the speakers in the headset, and it will detect input, but it won't get anything from the actual microphone (a mic and a speaker are basically the same concept in different forms.) This is happening.

I played Borderlands 2 last year and uninstalled. I installed it today again, and after downloading, usually a setup or 2 runs afaik, but it didn't happen when I installed this time. It worked perfectly last year. When I verify the integrity on steam, it shows 1 file is missing and will be fixed, but the sound doesn't work even after that. I've tried: 1. Uninstalling and re-installing. 2. Uninstalling sound drivers and reinstalling (Realtek HD Audio and Intel Display Audio using Driver Booste.

I have tried opening file location and running the .exe (Also tried making a shortcut on the desktop, it wouldn't open and gave the error code 0x80070057), I have tried updating and reinstalling realtek drivers multiple times. The reason I need to use the interface is kind of a long story.

I want it to be like this : https://imgur.com/a/xpTcUcT (https://imgur.com/a/xpTcUcT. I'm tired of my laptop feeling like it's on fire and on life support while I use it. It's an XPS 15 L511Z I bought in 2012. It's had a tough life I did not take good care of this poor thing. I download whatever I wanted without a second thought, I spilled water on it and fried the keyboard and it's never been opened and cleaned. But I'm also cheap and like DIY stuff so I was thinking instead of buying a new one I could try to give this guy the life he deserves for not dying all this time. Hello, I just received my Dell XPS 15 9570  My setup is the following: gt1 210-AOYM XPS 15 (9570) gt gt1 486-27723 CNX97007 gt gt1 338-BOMR 8th Generation Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-8950HK Processor (12M Cache, up to 4.8 GHz, 6 cores) gt gt1 391-BDSZ 15.6" 4K Ultra HD (3840 x 2160) InfinityEdge Anti-Reflective Touch IPS100% AdobeRGB 400-Nits display gt gt1 370-AEFR 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4 2666MHz gt gt1 400-AXKC 1TB M.2 2280 PCIe Solid State Drive. If you are looking for an inexpensive, functional notebook, you could want to think about starting up your quest with all the Dell Latitude 3590. This 15-inch laptop (that is also available in 14-inch and 13.2-inch 2-in-1 designs), comes with top safety features, Home windows ten Residence, High definition display screen, WLAN-capability, plus more.It truly is created to enable you to with basic responsibilities, with flexible connectivity capabilities like HDMI, VGA, USB Type-C Toshiba Satelite A100-796. I have Realtek HD Audio soundcard, however I didn't update any drivers so they are from 2005-2006. The audio port in my laptop is broken however the mic port works fine. Is there any possibility that when I will plug in green connector in the port of microphone I will receive sound? OS: Win XP 32bit. 
I think I am losing hope on this issue. I haven't been able to use this laptop for anything productive at all given that audio and video is such a great deal to my work. As I requested, dell has sent me a new replacement laptop for the laptop I had before which had the audio and video issue but I think life and dell just really hates because the replacement suffers from the same problem. I cannot for my life and dell technical supports deduce what is causing the videos to display the error. Hey all. I am attempting to use my gaming headset, which has separate microphone and sound plugs, on my XPS 15 9570. I am using a Y-cord to conjoin the microphone and sound into one connection which I can then plug into the device. The Realtek drivers are recognizing my headphones just fine, and are playing audio through them adequately. The problem is the microphone. The laptop seems to be defaulting to the 9570's built-in microphone rather than the headset microphone. I have tried a fresh. Apologies for creating a new thread about this issue, but I've tried every single fix presented on this board with no luck. This is a last ditch effort to get this working. I have an Intel Skull Canyon NUC that I've set up for gaming. I've resolved every issue I've run across trying to get games old and new running on the thing, but Borderlands has me stumped. Funny thing is, it was one of the first games I set up on the machine, and it was working perfectly. Recently it is not. The game starts. 
Note: All credits for this solution go to /u/tylerwatt12. I am merely summarizing his solution and reposting for visibility in case others have trouble finding an acceptable solution like I did. ampnbsp; 01. BACKGROUND A quick look through this sub shows that 9560 owners are generally satisfied with their machines, myself included. However, the XPS 15 is not without a few outstanding flaws, such as poor audio implementation. From the factory, Dell ships all 9560s with Realtek audio. gtKevin Shroff's Modded Realtek Drivers (KSMRD v1) Release: 7-17-17, based on Dell Realtek Driver 6.0.1.8105 Should work on other XPS laptops with Waves MaxxAudio too - untested About: This modded Realtek Audio driver disables the heavy post-processing sound effects from the stock Dell driver to allow for a clean, neutral, and flat audio experience. This is achieved by disabling Waves MaxxAudio throughout the driver, thus leaving intact only the essential core Realtek audio software. EDIT: I got Ethernet working using BCM5722D.kext (https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/files/file/928-bcm5722dkext/). I'm trying to get networking working on my Hackintosh, but nothing is working. I've tried installing the kexts through Multibeast, it had no effect. Then I gave up and tried HoRNDIS (https://github.com/jwise/HoRNDIS/issues/72) to tether from my phone. It had no effect, my phone doesn't show up. (kextload says the kext is already loaded, for some reason) My /EFI/CLOVER/kexts/O. </p>
